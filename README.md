2017:
Last year, I was a Python newbie, and I used a variety of languages (mostly Pike, Ruby or C).
For fun and to pass time over the 2017 christmas break, I'm going to redo them all in Python. 

2021: I'm more experienced with Python, and for fun redid them all (except for a couple boring
ones) in python 3.7. (back in 2017, I was still working on systems that had 2.6 installed!)
